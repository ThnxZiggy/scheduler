# Interview Scheduler  ðŸ“…


This project would not be possible without the wonderful help of Lighthouse Labs mentors, thank you!

## Project Description

Interview Scheduler is a single page app students can use to book appointments with interviewers built with React. Students can book one or many of 25 appointment slots with an interviewer of their choice. This is also mobile friendly!
